# CppProgram
This is a simple program designed to assist those within the financial industry. The main purpose of this program is to accept the initial investments, monthly investments, interest % and the # of years of the investment. The program will then calculate and output how much money the client will earn after the time period entered (both with and without monthly investments).


What did you do particularly well?
---- I feel that I was able to implement the requirements well. I was able to use arithmetic operations to evaluate the input variables and output the correct data.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-----Depending on the circumstances of how the program will be used, you could hard code in some variables, but it would require very specific circumstances. I think that if the program was going to be used by a particular client, adding some type of GUI would be nice to add some aesthetic appeal and not just have the I/O be done on a console window. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
-----The majority of the project was not too difficult. Where I found the most difficulty was in the formatting of the outputs. Getting it to output with two decimal places because it is dealing with currency was the most difficult part. I researched different ways to implement formatting within a CPP program with resources such as: msdn, youtube, and other various resources found through google.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
------All of them. It is important to know how to implement arithmetic operations in a program and also dealing with monetary values. The financial industry is a giant marketplace that is always looking for innovation and ways to make their jobs easier.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
----I made it maintainable by simplifying the code to the point where it fit the specifications, but did not add unnecessary elements that did not need to be there. I made it readable by adding necessary white space. I made it adaptable by allowing for user input of the variables, instead of static values. This allows for the user to help clients and show them how their investments would pay off after a certain time-frame.
